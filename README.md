# captionbot.js

A tiny JavaScript wrapper for Microsoft's Captionbot API.

# Installation

```
npm install captionbot.js
```

# Usage

### With a callback function

```javascript
const captionImage = require("captionbot.js").caption
var imageURL = "https://www.tinypetstube.com/wp-content/uploads/cute-puppy-picture-1.jpg"

caption(imageURL, (error, caption) => {

    if (error) {
        console.log("ERROR: " + error)
        return
    }

    console.log("Caption: " + caption)
    // => Caption: I think it's a dog standing on grass.

})
```

If a callback is not passed to the function, a promise will be returned:

### With promises, using .then()

```javascript
const captionImage = require("captionbot.js").caption
var imageURL = "https://zuwanu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cars-zuwanu.jpg"

caption(imageURL)
    .then((caption) => {

        console.log("Caption: " + caption)
        // => Caption: I think it's a car parked in a parking lot.

    })
    .catch((error) => {

        console.log("ERROR: " + error)

    })
```

### With promises, using async/await

```javascript
const captionImage = require("captionbot.js").caption
var imageURL = "http://www.aridzoneafforestation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/europeslostf.jpg"

async function printCaption(url) {

    try {

        var caption = await caption(url)
        console.log("Caption: " + caption)

    } catch (error) {

        console.log("ERROR: " + error)

    }

}

printCaption(imageURL)
// => Caption: I think it's a tree in a forest.
```

# Errors

**Three types of errors can occur while using Captionbot.js:**

**[1]** The first one is an error from the `request` package. It's not related to Captionbot.js. It can be caused if Microsoft has modified the Captionbot API URL or the request couldn't be made at all (you don't have an Internet connection). You will have to read the error message to figure it out.

The second and third ones are related.

**[2]** If the Captionbot API replies with "Did you upload an image?" the promise will be rejected with the reason `Image URL not specified.` (in the case of a promise):

```javascript
const captionImage = require("captionbot.js").caption
var problematicURLs = [null, undefined, ""]

var imageURL = problematicURLs[Math.floor(Math.random() * problematicURLs.length)]

caption(imageURL)
    .then((caption) => console.log(caption))
    .catch((error) => console.log("ERROR: " + error))
    // => ERROR: Image URL not specified.
```

**[3]** If the Captionbot API replies with "I really can't describe the picture ðŸ˜³" or "I'm not sure what you're asking" `Invalid image URL.` will be passed as `error` (in the case of a callback function):

```javascript
const captionImage = require("captionbot.js").caption
var problematicURLs = ["not a url", [], {}, "http://real.site/broken_img_404"]

var imageURL = problematicURLs[Math.floor(Math.random() * problematicURLs.length)]

caption(imageURL, (error, caption) => {

    if (error) {
        console.log("ERROR: " + error)
        // => ERROR: Invalid image URL.
        return
    }

    console.log(caption)

})
```

# Example captions

The example images used in the usage section along their captions.

### "I think it's a dog standing on grass."
<img src="https://www.tinypetstube.com/wp-content/uploads/cute-puppy-picture-1.jpg" width="300" >


### "I think it's a car parked in a parking lot."
<img src="https://zuwanu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cars-zuwanu.jpg" width="300" >

### "I think it's a tree in a forest."
<img src="http://www.aridzoneafforestation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/europeslostf.jpg" width="300" >

(as we can see in the last two captions, Captionbot is not very good at counting :P)

# Disclaimer

This wrapper was not made by Microsoft. All image processing is made by Azure's Captionbot. This package only facilitates the process of retrieving the captions.
